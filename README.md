# EscapeRoomExperiment01
A simple, experimental design for an electronic element for an escape room. Uses an LCD screen, 4x3 keypad, and audio elements.

Components used currently include an Arduino Mega (R3), Standard 16x2 character LCD and an 1824 4x3 keypad from Adafruit.

-current functionality: reading inputs from keypad and displaying them on LCD
                        storing strings up to 16 characters long
                        comparing input string from keypad to preset "password string"
                        clearing input strings 
                        

-planned functionality: setting a custom password 
                        audio prompts for button presses, success and failure, etc.
                        operation of a servo motor for locking function
                        Wireless communication for recording escape room progress.
